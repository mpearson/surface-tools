# Surface Tools

This repo is an experimental sandbox for 3D mesh manipulation and simulation in the browser.
Algorithm demos will be implemented in React/Typescript and THREE.js, built using vite.js.
Algorithms and data structures will be implemented in rust and compiled to WASM.


# Goals

[ ] Figure out how to do Rust -> webassembly
[ ] Port the Half-Edge data structure from https://github.com/mpearson/surface-tools-unity
